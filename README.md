# Bmore-public-vote
[Bmore public vote] is a ReactJS, NodeJS and Express project. It makes use of Legistar, software currently being used in municipalities across the United States to display City Council activity for the public. The app uses the Legistar API to display top level information on matters in motion in the City Council and allows for them to be voted on by users. Intended to be used for Baltimore city, Legistar API access is currently blocked by the city and therefore, as a temporary substitute, Seattle city data is being used. 
  
The ultimate purpose of the project is to make proposed legislation more known and accessible to the public and allow for the public to weigh in on measures, giving space for public opinion to be voiced and heard.
