# Bmore-public-vote
[Bmore public vote] is a project centered around a digital space (website) where measures passing through Baltimore City government, such as the Mayor's Office, the Baltimore City Council, Office of the Comptroller, can be viewed and voted on by the public.
  
The purpose of the project is to make proposed legislation more known and accessible to the public and allow for the public to weigh in on measures, giving space for public opinion to be voiced and heard.
